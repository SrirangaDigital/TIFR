\chapter*{Preface}

In this course of lectures I have discussed the elementary
parts of Stochastic Processes from the view point of 
Markov Processes. I owe much to Professor H.P. McKean's lecture
at Kyoto University (1957--58) in the preparation of these lectures.

I would like to express my hearty thanks to Professor 
K. Chandrasekharan, Dr.K. Balagangadharan, Dr.J.R. Choksi
and Mr.K.M. Rao for their friendly aid in preparing the manuscript.
