There are notes of course of lectures on Field theory aimed at
providing the beginner with an introduction to algebraic extensions,
algebraic function fields, formally real fields and valuated fields.
These lectures were preceded by an elementary course on group theory,
vector spaces and ideal theory of rings---especially of Noetherian rings.
A knowledge of these is presupposed in these notes. In addition, we 
assume a familiarity with the elementary topology of topological groups 
and of the real and complex number fields. 

Most of the material of these notes is to be found in the 
notes of Artin and the books of Artin, Bourbaki, Pickert and
Van-der-Waerden.

My thanks are due to Mr. S. Raghavan for his help in the writing of these
notes.
