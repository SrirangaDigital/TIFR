These are notes of a part of lectures which I gave at the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research in 1966. They were intented as a
first introduction to algebraic Topology.

My thanks are due to V.J. Lal for his careful preparation of these
notes, and to the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research for its kind
invitation.
