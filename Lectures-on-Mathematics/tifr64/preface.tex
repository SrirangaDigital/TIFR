\medskip

THESE ARE NOTES based on the lectures given at the T.I.F.R.\@ Centre,
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, during July and August of
1977. Starting from Brownian Motion, the lectures quickly got into the
areas of Stochastic Differential Equations and Diffusion Theory. An
attempt was made to introduce to the students diverse aspects of the
theory. The last section on Martingales is based on some additional
lectures given by K.\@ Ramamurthy of the Indian Institute of
Science. The author would like to express his appreciation of the
efforts by Tara R.\@ Nanda and PL.\@ Muthuramalingam whose dedication
and perseverance has made these notes possible.
