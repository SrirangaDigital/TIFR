\medskip

\noindent
\textsc{This} book reproduces, with some additions, the contents of a course of lectures given at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay in January/February 1964.

\smallskip

During the elaboration of the material here presented, I benefited from numerous discussions with various mathematicians, notably H. Cartan, G. Glaeser, L. Schwartz and R. Thom, and drew much profit from these discussions. In particular, I consider it my duty to state that one of the main results, ``the preparation theorem for differentiable functions'', was proposed to me as a conjecture by R. Thom, and that he had to make a great effort to overcome my initial scepticism.

\smallskip

I would like also to thank specially Raghavan Narasimhan and N. Venkateswara Rao, who wrote one part of these notes and translated the rest, and despite their own work, have undertaken all the work connected with the publication of this book.
