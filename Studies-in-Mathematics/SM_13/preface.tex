{\bf INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM ON GEOMETRY AND ANALYSIS}

AN INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM  on `Geometry and Analysis' was held at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay from January 6 to January 14, 1992. Professors M. S. Narasimhan and C.S. Seshadri turned sixty at about this time. In view of the crucial role both of them played in the evolutions of the School of Mathematics as a centre of excellence, it was considered appropriate to devote the Colloquium to recent developments in areas of geometry and analysis close to their research interests, and to felicitate them on this occasion. The range of topics dealt with included vector bundles, moduli theory, complex geometry, algebraic and quantum groups, and differential equations. The Colloquium was co-sponsored by the International Mathematical Union and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and was financially supported by them and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.

The Organizing Committee for the Colloquium consisted of Professors Kashmibai, David Mumford, Gopal Prasad, R. Parthasarathy (Chairman), M.S. Raghunathan, T. R. Ramadas, S. Ramanan and R. R. Simha. The International Mathematical Union was represented by Professor Mumford.

The following mathematicians gave one-hour addresses at the Colloquium: S.S. Abhyankar, A. Adimurthy, A. Beauville, F.A. Bogomolov, C. de Concini, J.P. Demailly, W. J. Haboush, G. Harder, A. Hirschowitz, N. J. Hitchin, S. P. Inamber, K. T. Joseph, G. R. Kempf, V. Lakshmibai, H. Lange, M. Maruyama, D. Mumford, M. P. Murthy, N. Nitsure, M. V. Nori, K. Okamoto, C. Procesi, N. Raghavendra, S. Ramanan, Y. T. Siu, V. Srinivas, S. Subramanian, G. Trautmann. Besides the members of the School of Mathematics of the Tata Institute, mathematicians from universities and educational institutions in India and abroad were also invited to attend the Colloquium.

\newpage

The social programme for the Colloquium included a Tea Party on January 9, a documentary film on 6 January, a Carnatic Flute Recital on January 8, a Hindustani Vocal Recital on January 11, a Kathakali Dance on January 13, a Dinner at Gallops Restaurant, Mahalaxmi on January 12, an Excursion to Elephanta Caves on January 14, and a Farewell Dinner Party on January 14, 1992.
