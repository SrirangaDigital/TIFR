I\pageoriginale send my geetings and good wishes to the International Colloquium on Zeta Funtions and the South Asian Conference on Mathematical Education which are being organised by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay. This Institute has been recognised by the Government of India as the national centre for advanced study and fundamental research in mathematics and it is appropriate that it should hold this colloquium and conference.

Mathematics is supposed to be a dull subject, but it is increasingly recongnised that it is of high importance in scientific developments today. Indeed, mathematical research has widened the horizon of the human mind tremendously and has helped in the understanding, to some extent, of nature and the physical world. It is a vehicle today of exact scientific thought. India has had the good fortune in the past to produce some very eminent mathematicians. I hope that the conferences that are being held in Bombay will foster this intellectual activity in the higher spheres of the mind and thus help in the progress of humanity.
