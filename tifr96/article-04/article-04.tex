\textsc{Let}\pageoriginale $L$ be a group. We denote by $E(L)$ the quotient group $\Aut L/\Int L$ of the group $\Aut L$ of automorphisms of $L$ by the group $\Int L$ of inner automorphisms $\Int a:x\to a.x.a^{-1}(a,x\in L)$ of $L$. Our first aim is to show that $E(L)$ is finite if $L$ is arithmetic, $S$-arithmetic (see \ref{art03-sec3.2}) or uniform in a semi-simple Lie group (with some exceptions, see Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5}, Theorem \ref{art03-thm3.6} and Theorem \ref{art03-thm5.2} for the precise statements). A slight variant of the proof also shows that in these cases $L$ is not isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index. As a consequence, a Riemannian symmetric space with negative curvature, and no flat component, has infinitely many non-homeomorphic compact Clifford-Klein forms, Theorem \ref{art03-thm6.2}.

Further information on $E(L)$ is obtained when $L$ is an $S$-arithmetic group of a semi-simple $k$-group $G$ (with some conditions on $G$ and $S$). If $L$ contains the center of $G_{k}$, and $G$ is simply connected, then $E(L)$ is essentially generated by four kinds of automorphisms: exterior automorphisms of $G$, automorphisms deduced from certain automorphisms of $k$, automorphisms of the form $x\to f(x)\cdot x$ where $f$ is a suitable homomorphism of $L$ into the center of $G_{k}$, and automorphisms induced by the normalizer $N(L)$ of $L$ in $G$ (see Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.8}, Remark in \ref{art03-sec1.9}). In the case where $G$ is split and $L$ is the group of $\mathfrak{o}(S)$-points of $G$ for its canonical integral structure, there results are made more precise (Theorem \ref{art03-thm2.2}, Theorem \ref{art03-thm4.3}), and $N(L)/L$ is put into relation with the $S$-ideal class group of $k$ and $S$-units (see Lemma \ref{art03-lem2.3}, Lemma \ref{art03-lem4.5}; these results overlap with those of Allan \cite{art03-key1}, \cite{art03-key2}). As an illustration, we discuss $\Aut L$ for some classical groups (Examples \ref{art03-exam2.6}, \ref{art03-exam4.6}). The results are related to those of O'Meara \cite{art03-key24} if $G=\SL_{n}$, and of Hua-Reiner \cite{art03-key12}, \cite{art03-key13} and Reiner \cite{art03-key27} if $G=\SL_{n}$, $\Sp_{2n}$, and $k=\bfQ$, $\bfQ(i)$.

The\pageoriginale finiteness of $E(L)$ follows here rather directly from rigidity theorems \cite{art03-key25}, \cite{art03-key26}, \cite{art03-key32}, \cite{art03-key33}. The connection between the two is established by Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1}.

\begin{notation*}
In this paper, all algebraic groups are linear, and we follow in general the notations and conventions of \cite{art03-key9}. In particular, we make no notational distinction between an algebraic group $G$ over a field $k$ and its set of points in an algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ of the field of definition (usually $\bfC$ here). The Lie algebra of a real Lie group or of an algebraic group is denoted by the corresponding German letter.
\end{notation*}

If $L$ is a group and $V$ a $L$-module, then $H^{1}(L,V)$ is the 1st cohomology group of $L$ with coefficients in $V$. In particular, if $L$ is a subgroup of the Lie group $G$, then $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g})$ is the 1st cohomology group of $L$ with coefficients in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$, on which $L$ operates by the adjoint representation.

A closed subgroup $L$ of a topological group $G$ is {\em uniform} if $G/L$ is compact.

\section{Uniform or arithmetic subgroups}\label{art03-sec1}

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem1.1}
Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $\bfR$, $L$ a finitely generated subgroup of $G_{\bfR}$ and $N$ the normalizer of $L$ in $G_{\bfR}$. Assume that $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g})=0$. Then the group of automorphisms of $L$ induced by elements of $N$ has finite index in $\Aut L$.
\end{lemma}

Let $L_{0}$ be a group isomorphic to $L$ and $\iota$ an isomorphism of $L_{0}$ onto $L$. For $M=G_{\bfR}$, $G$, let $R(L_{0},M)$ be the set of homomorphisms of $L_{0}$ into $M$. Let $(x_{i})(1\leq i\leq q)$ be a generating set of elements of $L$. Then $R(L_{0},M)$ may be identified with a subset of $M^{q}$, namely, the set of $m$-uples $(y_{i})$ which satisfy a set of defining relations for $L_{0}$ in the $x_{i}$, $x_{i}^{-1}$. In particular $R(L_{0},G)$ is an affine algebraic set over $\bfR$, whose set of real points is $R(L_{0},G_{\bfR})$. The group $M$ operates on $R(L_{0},M)$, by composition with inner automorphisms, and $G$ is an algebraic transformation group of $R(L_{0},G)$, with action defined over $\bfR$.

To\pageoriginale $\alpha\in \Aut L$, let us associate the element $j(\alpha)=\alpha\circ \iota$ of $R(L_{0},G)$. The map $j$ is then a bijection of $\Aut L$ onto the set $I(L_{0},L)\subset R(L_{0},G_{\bfR})$ of isomorphisms of $L_{0}$ onto $L$. If $a$, $b\in I(L_{0},L)$, then $b\in G_{\bfR}(a)$ if and only if there exists $n\in N$ such that $b=(\Int n)\circ a$. Our assertion is therefore equivalent to: ``$I(L_{0},L)$ is contained in finitely many orbits of $G_{\bfR}$,'' which we now prove.

Let $b\in I(L_{0},L)$. Since
$$
H^{1}(b(L^{0}),\mathfrak{g})=H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g})=H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g}_{\bfR})\otimes \bfC,
$$
we also have $H^{1}(b(L_{0}),\mathfrak{g})=0$. By the lemma of \cite{art03-key33}, it follows that the orbit $G(b)$ contains a Zariski-open subset of $R(L_{0},G)$. Since the latter is the union of finitely many irreducible components, this shows that $I(L_{0},L)$ is contained in finitely many orbits of $G$. But an orbit of $G$ containing a real point can be identified to a homogeneous space $G/H$ where $H$ is an algebraic subgroup of $G$, defined over $\bfR$. Therefore its set of real points is the union of finitely many orbits of $G_{\bfR}$(\cite{art03-key8}, \S6.4), whence our contention.

\begin{remark}\label{art03-rem1.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] The lemma and its proof remain valid if $\bfR$ and $\bfC$ are replaced by a locally compact field of characteristic zero $K$ and an algebraically closed extension of $K$.

\item[(ii)] The group $\SL(2,\bfZ)$ has a subgroup of finite index $L$ isomorphic to the free group on $m$ generators, where $m\geq 2$ (and in fact may be taken arbitrarily large). The group $E(L)$ has the group $\GL(m,\bfZ)=\Aut (L/(L,L))$ as a quotient, hence is infinite. On the other hand, $L$ has finite index in its normalizer in $\SL(2,\bfC)$, as is easily checked (and follows from Proposition \ref{art03-prop3.3}(d)). Thus, \ref{art03-lem1.1} implies that $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g})\neq 0$, as is well known. Similarly, taking (i) into account, we see that the free uniform subgroups of $\PSL(2,\bfQ_{p})$ constructed by Ihara \cite{art03-key15} have non-zero first cohomology group with coefficients in $\mathfrak{g}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem1.3}
Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $\bfR$, $L$ a finitely generated discrete subgroup of $G_{\bfR}$ such that $G_{\bfR}/L$ has finite invariant measure. Assume that $H^{1}(L',\mathfrak{g})=0$ for all subgroups of finite index $L'$ of $L$. Then $L$ is not isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index.
\end{lemma}

Define\pageoriginale $L_{0}$, $M$, $\iota$, $R(L_{0},M)$ and the action of $M$ on $R(L_{0},M)$ as in the proof of Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1}. Let $C$ be the set of monomorphisms of $L_{0}$ onto subgroups of finite index of $L$. Then, $j:\alpha\mapsto \alpha\circ \iota$ is a bijection of $C$ onto a subset $J$ of $R(L_{0},G_{\bfR})$, and the argument of Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1} shows that $J$ is contained in the union of finitely many orbits of $G_{\bfR}$. Fix a Haar measure on $G_{\bfR}$, and hence on all quotients of $G_{\bfR}$ by discrete subgroups. The total measure $m(G_{\bfR}/L')$ is finite for every subgroup of finite index of $L$, since $m(G_{\bfR}/L)$ is finite. If $b$, $c\in C$, and $b=\Int g\circ c$, $(g\in G_{\bfR})$, then $m(G_{\bfR}/b(L))=m(G_{\bfR}/c(L))$. Consequently, $m(G_{\bfR}/L')$ takes only finitely many values, as $L'$ runs through the subgroups of finite index of $L$, isomorphic to $L$. But, if there is one such group $L'\neq L$, then there is one of arbitrary high index in $L$, a contradiction.

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem1.4}
Let $L$ be a finitely generated group, $M$ a normal subgroup of finite index, whose center is finitely generated, $N$ a characteristic finite subgroup of $L$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\rm(a)}] If $E(M)$ is finite, then $E(L)$ is finite.

\item[{\rm(b)}] If $E(L/N)$ is finite, then $E(L)$ is finite.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] It is well known and elementary that a finitely generated group contains only finitely many subgroups of a given finite index (see e.g. \cite{art03-key11}). Therefore, the group $\Aut (L,M)$ of automorphisms of $L$ leaving $M$ stable has finite index in $\Aut(L)$. Since $L/M$ is finite, the subgroup $Q$ of elements of $\Aut(L,M)$ inducing the identity on $L/M$ has also finite index. Let $r:Q\to \Aut M$ be the restriction map. Our assumption implies that $r^{-1}(\Int M)$ has finite index in $Q$, hence that $\Int L\cdot \ker r$ is a subgroup of finite index of $Q\cdot \Int L$. It suffices therefore to show that $\ker r\cap \Int L$ has finite index in $\ker r$. Let $b\in \ker r$. Write
$$
b(x)=u_{x}\cdot x(x\in L).
$$
Then $u_{x}\in M$ and routine checking shows: the map $u:x\mapsto u_{x}$ is a 1-cocycle on $L$, with coefficients in the center $C$ of $M$, which is constant on the cosets mod $M$, and may consequently be viewed as a $1$-cocycle of $L/M$ with coefficients in $C$; furthermore, two cocycles thus associated to elements $b$, $c\in Q$ are cohomologous if and only if there\pageoriginale exists $n\in C$ such that $b=\Int n\circ c$, and any such cocycle is associated to an automorphism. Therefore
$$
\ker r/\Int_{L}C\cong H^{1}(L/M,C).
$$
By assumption, $L/M$ is finite, and $C$ is finitely generated. Hence the right hand side is finite, which implies our assertion.

\item[(b)] The group $N$ being characteristic, we have a natural homomorphism $\pi:\Aut L\to \Aut L/N$. The finiteness of $E(L/N)$ implies that $\Int L\cdot \ker \pi$ has finite index in $\Aut L$. Moreover $\ker \pi$ consists of automorphisms of the form $x\mapsto x\cdot v_{x}$, $(x\in L, v_{x}\in N)$, and is finite, since $N$ is finite and $L$ is finitely generated.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}\label{art03-thm1.5}
Let $G$ be a semi-simple Lie group, with finitely many connected components, whose identity component $G^{0}$ has a finite center, and $L$ a discrete subgroup of $G$. Then $E(L)$ is finite if one of the two following conditions is fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\rm(a)}] $G/L$ is compact, $G^{0}$ has no non-compact three-dimensional factor;

\item[{\rm(b)}] $\Aut(\mathfrak{g}\otimes \bfC)$ may be identified with an algebraic group $G'$ over $\bfQ$, such that the image $L'$ of $L\cap G$ in $G'$ by the natural projection is an arithmetic subgroup of $G'$, and $G'_{\bfR}$ has no factor locally isomorphic to $\SL(2,\bfR)$ on which the projection of $L'$ is discrete.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Let $A$ be the greatest compact normal subgroup of $G^{0}$ and $\pi:G^{0}\to G^{0}/A$ the canonical projection. Since the center of $G^{0}$ is finite, it is contained in $A$, and $G^{0}/A$ is the direct product of non-compact simple groups with center reduced to $\{e\}$. The group $\pi(L\cap G^{0})$ is discrete and uniform in $G^{0}/A$. By density \cite{art03-key4}, its center is contained in the center of $G^{0}/A$, hence is reduced to $\{e\}$. Consequently, the center of $L\cap G^{0}$ is contained in $A\cap L$, hence is finite. We may then apply Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}(a), which reduces us to the case where $G$ is connected. Moreover, by \cite{art03-key4}, any finite normal subgroup of $\pi(L)$ is central in $G/A$, hence reduced to $\{e\}$. Therefore $A\cap L$ is the greatest finite normal subgroup of $L$, and is characteristic. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}(b), it suffices to show that $E(\pi(L))$ is finite. We are thus reduced to the case where $G$ has no\pageoriginale center, and is a direct product of non-compact simple groups of dimension $>3$. In particular, $G$ is of finite index in the group of real points of an algebraic group defined over $\bfR$, namely $\Aut (\mathfrak{g}\otimes \bfC)$. By a theorem of Weil \cite{art03-key33}, $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g})=0$, hence by Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1}, it is enough to show that $L$ has finite index in its normalizer $N(L)$. By \cite{art03-key4}, $N(L)$ is discrete. Since $G/L$ is fibered by $N(L)/L$, and is compact, $N(L)/L$ is finite.

\item[(b)] Let $A$ be the greatest normal $\bfQ$-subgroup of ${G'}^{0}$, whose group of real points is compact, and let $\pi$ be the composition of the natural homomorphisms
$$
G^{0}\to \Ad \mathfrak{g}\to ({G'}^{0})_{\bfR}/A_{\bfR}.
$$
$G'/A$ is a $\bfQ$-group without center, which is a product of $\bfQ$-simple groups, each of which has dimension $>3$ and a non-compact group of real points. $\pi(L)$ is arithmetic in $G'/A$(\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 6) and $L\cap \ker \pi$ is finite. By Zariski-density (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 1), any finite normal subgroup of $\pi(L)$ is central in $G'/A$, hence reduced to $\{e\}$. Thus $L\cap \ker \pi$ is the greatest finite normal subgroup of $L$, and is characteristic. Also the center of $\pi(L\cap G^{0})$ is central in $\Ad G'$, hence reduced to $\{e\}$, and the center of $L\cap G^{0}$ is compact, and therefore finite. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}, we are thus reduced to the case where $G$, $G'$ are connected, $A=\{e\}$, and $L$ is arithmetic in $G'$. Let $G_{1},\ldots,G_{q}$ be the simple $\bfQ$-factors of $G'$. The group $L$ is commensurable with the product of the intersections $L_{i}=L\cap G_{i}$, which are arithmetic (\cite{art03-key7}, 6.3). If $G_{i}\cap L$ is uniform in $G_{i\bfR}$, then $H^{1}(L_{i},\mathfrak{g}_{\bfR})=0$ by \cite{art03-key33}. If not, then $rk_{Q}G_{i}\geq 1$, and $H^{1}(L_{i},\mathfrak{g}_{i})=0$ by theorems of Raghunathan \cite{art03-key25}, \cite{art03-key26}. Consequently, $H^{1}(L\cap G',\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfR})=0$. Moreover, $L\cap G'$ is of finite index in its normalizer $N$. In fact, $N$ is closed, belongs to $G'_{\bfQ}$ (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 2), hence to $G'_{\bfR}$, and $N/(L\cap G')$ is compact since $G'_{\bfR}/(L\cap G')$ has finite invariant measure \cite{art03-key7}. The conclusion now follows from Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1} and Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem1.6}
Let $L$ be a finitely generated group, $N$ a normal subgroup of finite index. Assume $L$ is isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index. Then $N$ has a subgroup of finite index which is isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index.
\end{lemma}

The\pageoriginale assumption implies the existence of a strictly decreasing sequence $(L_{i})(i=1,2,\ldots)$ of subgroups of finite index of $L$ and of isomorphisms $f_{i}:L\xrightarrow{\sim}L_{i}(i=1,2,\ldots)$. Let $a$ be the index of $N$ in $L$. Then $L_{i}\cap N$ has index $\leq a$ in $L_{i}$, hence $M_{i}=f^{-1}_{i}(L_{i}\cap N)$ has index $\leq a$. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that $M_{i}$ is independent of $i$. Then, $L_{i}\cap N$ is isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index.

\begin{proposition}\label{art03-prop1.7}
Let $G$ and $L$ be as in Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5}. Assume one of the conditions (a), (b) of Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5} to be fulfilled. Then $L$ is not isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index.
\end{proposition}

By use of Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.6}, the proof is first reduced to the case where $G$ is connected. Let $\pi$ be as in the proof of (a) or (b) in Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5}. Then $L\cap \ker \pi$ is the greatest finite normal subgroup of $L$. Similarly $L'\cap \ker \pi$ is the greatest finite normal subgroup of $L'$, if $L'$ has finite index in $L$. Therefore, if $L'$ is isomorphic to $L$, the groups $\ker \pi \cap L$ and $\ker \pi \cap L'$ are equal, and are mapped onto each other by any isomorphism of $L$ onto $L'$; hence $\pi(L)\cong \pi(L')$, and $\pi(L)\neq \pi(L')$ if $L\neq L'$. We are thus reduced to the case where the group $A$ of (a) or (b) in Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4} is $=\{e\}$. Moreover, in case (b), it suffices to consider $L\cap G'$ in view of Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.6}. Our assertion then follows from the rigidity theorems of Weil and Raghunathan and from Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.3}.

We shall need the following consequence of a theorem of Raghunathan:

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem1.8}
Let $G$, $G'$ be connected semi-simple $\bfQ$-groups, which are almost simple over $\bfQ$. Let $L$ be a subgroup of $G_{\bfQ}$ containing an arithmetic subgroup $L_{0}$ of $G$, and $s$ an isomorphism of $L$ onto a subgroup of $G'_{\bfQ}$ which maps $L_{0}$ onto a Zariski-dense subgroup of $G'$. Assume that $rk_{\bfQ}(G)\geq 2$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\rm(i)}] $G$ and $G'$ are isogeneous over $\bfQ$.

\item[{\rm(ii)}] If $G$ is simply connected, or $G'$ is centerless, there exists a $\bfQ$-isogeny $s'$ of $G$ onto $G'$, and a homomorphism $g$ of $L$ into the center of $G'_{\bfQ}$ such that $s(x)=s'(x)\cdot g(x)(x\in L)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

Let\pageoriginale $\widehat{G}$ be the universal covering group of $G$, $\pi:\widetilde{G}\to G$ the canonical projection and $\widetilde{L}=\pi^{-1}(L)\cap G_{\bfQ}$. The group $\widetilde{L}_{0}=\pi^{-1}(L_{0})\cap \widetilde{L}$ is arithmetic, as follows e.g. from (\cite{art03-key7}, \S6.11); in particular, $\pi(\widetilde{L}_{0})$ has finite index in $L_{0}$, and $L'_{0}=s\circ \pi(\widetilde{L}_{0})$ is Zariski-dense in $G'$.

We identify $G'$ with a $\bfQ$-subgroup of $\GL(n,\bfC)$, for some $n$. The map $r=s\circ\pi$ may be viewed as a linear representation of $\widetilde{L}$ into $\GL(n,\bfQ)$. By Theorem 1 of \cite{art03-key25}, there exists a normal subgroup $\widetilde{N}$ of $\widetilde{L}_{0}$, Zariski-dense in $\widetilde{G}$, and a morphism $t:\widetilde{G}\to \GL(n,\bfC)$ which coincides with $r$ on $\widetilde{N}$. Let $C$ be the Zariski-closure of $t(\widetilde{N})$. It is an algebraic subgroup contained in $t(\widetilde{G})\cap G'$. Since $t(\widetilde{N})$ is normal in $L'_{0}$, and $L'_{0}$ is Zariski-dense, the group $C$ is normal in $G'$. However, (\cite{art03-key9}, \S6.21(ii)), the group $G'$ is isogeneous to a group $R_{k/\bfQ}H$, where $k$ is a number field, $H$ an absolutely simple $k$-group, and $R_{k/\bfQ}$ denotes restriction of the scalars (\cite{art03-key31}, Chap. I). Consequently, an infinite subgroup of $G'_{\bfQ}$ is not contained in a proper direct factor of $G'$, whence $C=G'=t(\widetilde{G})$. If $f$ is a regular function defined over $\bfQ$ on $G'$, then $f\circ t$ is a regular function on $\widetilde{G}$, which takes rational values on the dense set $\widetilde{N}$. It follows immediately that $f\circ t$ is defined over $\bfQ$, hence $t$ is defined over $\bfQ$. Its kernel is a proper normal $\bfQ$-subgroup of $G'$, hence is finite, and $t$ is a $\bfQ$-isogeny. This implies (i).

If $G'$ is centerless, then $Z(\widetilde{Z})$ belongs to the kernel of $t$. Thus, if $G$ is simply connected, or $G'$ centerless, $t$ defines a $\bfQ$-isogeny $s'$ of $G$ onto $G'$, which coincides with $s$ on the Zariski-dense subgroup $N=\pi(\widetilde{N})$. The group $s(N)$ is then Zariski-dense in $G'$. Let $x\in L$, $y\in N$. Then $x\cdot y\cdot x^{-1}\in N$, hence $s(x)\cdot s'(x)^{-1}$ centralizes $s(N)$, and therefore also $G'$. Consequently, $s(x)\cdot S'(x)^{-1}$ belongs to $G'_{\bfQ}\cap Z(G')$, and $f:x\mapsto s(x)\cdot s'(x)^{-1}$, and $s'$ fulfil our conditions.

\begin{theorem}\label{art03-thm1.9}
Let $G$ and $L$ be as in Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.8}. Assume $G$ to be centerless and $L$ to be equal to its normalizer in $G_{\bfQ}$. Then $E(L)$ may be identified with a subgroup of $(\Aut G)_{\bfQ}/(\Int G)_{\bfQ}$.
\end{theorem}

If $G$ is centerless, and $M$ is a Zariski-dense subgroup of $G_{\bfQ}$, then the normalizer of $M$ in $G$ belongs to $G_{\bfQ}$. This follows from Theorem\pageoriginale 2 in \cite{art03-key6} if $M$ is arithmetic, but the proof yields this more general statement, as well as Proposition \ref{art03-prop3.3}(b) below. In view of this, Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.9} is a consequence of Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.8},

\begin{remark*}
It is no great loss in generality to assume that $L$ contains the center of $G_{\bfQ}$, and this assumption will in fact be fulfilled in the cases to be considered below. In this case, $\Aut L$ is generated by three kinds of automorphisms: (a) exterior automorphisms of $G$ leaving $L$ stable, (b) automorphisms $x\mapsto f(x)\cdot x$, where $f$ is a homomorphism of $L$ into its center, (c) automorphisms of the form $x\mapsto y\cdot x\cdot y^{-1}$, where $y$ belongs to the normalizer of $L$ in $G$.
\end{remark*}

Using some information on these three items, we shall in the following paragraph give a more precise description of $\Aut L$, when $G$ is a split group.

\section{Arithmetic subgroups of split groups over $\bfQ$}\label{art03-sec2}

{\em In this paragraph $G$ is a connected semi-simple and almost simple $\bfQ$-group, which is split, of $\bfQ$-rank $\geq 2$; $L$ is the group of integral points of $G$ for the canonical $\bfZ$-structure associated to a splitting of $G$\cite{art03-key10}, \cite{art03-key18}, and $N(L)$ the normalizer of $L$ in $G_{\bfC}$.}

\subsection{}\label{art03-sec2.1}
The group $L$ is equal to its normalizer in $G_{\bfQ}$, and also to its normalizer in $G$ if $G$ has no center. To see this, we first notice that $L$ has finite index in its normalizer in $G$. In fact, since the image of $L$ in $\Int G$ is arithmetic (\cite{art03-key7}, \S6.11), it suffices to show that if $G$ is centerless, any arithmetic subgroup of $G$ is of finite index in its normalizer, which follows from the end argument of Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5}(b). Our assertion is then a consequence of (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 7). Another proof will be given below (Theorem \ref{art03-thm4.3}).

\setcounter{theorem}{1}
\begin{theorem}\label{art03-thm2.2}
If $G$ is centerless, then $\Aut L$ is a split extension of $E(G)=\Aut G/\Int G$ by $L$. If $G$ is simply connected, then $\Aut L$ is a split extension of $E(G)$ by the subgroup $A$ of automorphisms of the form $x\mapsto f(x)\cdot y\cdot x\cdot y^{-1}$ where $y\in N(L)$ and $f$ is a homomorphism of $L$ into its center.
\end{theorem}

If $G$ is centerless or simply connected, the standard construction of automorphisms of $G$ leaving stable the splitting of $G$ yields a subgroup\pageoriginale $E'(G)$ of $(\Aut G)_{\bfQ}$, isomorphic to $E(G)$ under the canonical projection, and leaving the $\bfZ$-structure of $G$ invariant. Thus $E(G)$ may be identified with a subgroup of $\Aut L$. If $G$ is centerless, the theorem follows then from Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.9}, and \ref{art03-thm2.1}. Let now $G$ be simple connected. Let $s\in \Aut L$. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.8}, we can find $s'\in (\Aut G)_{\bfQ}$ and $f\in \Hom (L,Z(G)_{\bfQ})$ such that $s(x)=f(x)\cdot s'(x)(x\in L)$. However, $L$ contains $Z(G)_{\bfQ}$ by \ref{art03-sec2.1}. Therefore, $f$ maps $L$ into $Z(G)\cap L$. But $Z(G)\cap L$ is equal to the center of $L$, since $L$ is Zariski-dense in $G$, whence our assertion.

If $G$ has a non-trivial center the image of $N(L)$ in $\Aut L$ is in general different from $\Int L$. The quotient $N(L)/L$ has been studied in various cases, including those of Examples \ref{art03-exam2.6}(1), (2), notably by Maass, Ramanathan, Allan (see \cite{art03-key1}, where references to earlier work are also given). We shall discuss it here and in \S4 from a somewhat different point of view. In the following statement, the group $G'=\Int G$ is endowed with the $\bfZ$-structure associated to the splitting defined by the given splitting of $G$.

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem2.3}
Let $\pi:G\to G'=\Int G$ be the canonical projection, $T$ the maximal torus given by the splitting of $G$, and $T'=\pi(T)$. Then
\begin{equation}
\pi(N(L))=G'_{\bfZ},\label{art03-eq1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\pi(N(L))/\Int L\cong T'_{\bfZ}/\pi (T_{\bfZ})\cong Z(L).\label{art03-eq2}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

The group $L$ is the normalizer in $G_{\bfQ}$ of a Chevalley lattice $\mathfrak{g}_{\bfZ}$ in $\mathfrak{g}$ as follows from 2.17 in \cite{art03-key16}. Moreover, a Chevalley lattice is spanned by the logarithms of the unipotent elements in $L$. Consequently $N(L)$ is the normalizer in $G$ of $\mathfrak{g}_{\bfZ}$. From this \eqref{art03-eq1} follows.

Let $B$ be the maximal solvable subgroup of $G$ corresponding to the positive roots in the given splitting of $G$ and $U$ its unipotent radical. Then $B=T\cdot U$ (semi-direct). Let $x\in N(L)$. Since $\Int x$ preserves the $\bfQ$-structure of $G$, the group $x\cdot B\cdot x^{-1}$ is a maximal connected solvable subgroup defined over $\bfQ$, hence (\cite{art03-key9}, \S4.13) there exists $z\in G_{\bfQ}$ such that $z\cdot B\cdot z^{-1}=x\cdot B\cdot x^{-1}$. But we have $G_{\bfQ}=L\cdot B_{\bfQ}$(\cite{art03-key6}, Lemma 1). Since $B$ is equal to its normalizer, it follows that $N(L)=L\cdot (N(L)\cap B)$. Let now $x\in N(L)\cap B$. Write $x=t\cdot v(t\in T,v\in U)$. We have $\pi(x)\in L$ (see \ref{art03-sec2.1}).\pageoriginale But, with respect to a suitable basis of a Chevalley lattice in $\mathfrak{g}_{\bfQ}$, $\pi(t)$ is diagonal, and $\pi(u)$ upper triangular, unipotent, therefore $\pi(t)$, $\pi(u)\in L$. However \cite{art03-key10}, $\pi$ defines a $\bfZ$-isomorphism of $U$ onto $\pi(U)$, hence $u\in L$, which shows that
\begin{equation}
N(L)=L\cdot (N(L)\cap T).\label{art03-eq3}
\end{equation}
The kernel of $\pi$ is contained in $T$, therefore \eqref{art03-eq1} implies that $N(L)\cap T$ is the full inverse image of $T'_{\bfZ}$, which yields the first equality of \eqref{art03-eq2}. The groups $T_{\bfZ}$ and $T'_{\bfZ}$ consist of the elements of order 2 of $T$ and $T'$ respectively and are both isomorphic to $(\bfZ/2\bfZ)^{l}$, where $l$ is the rank of $G$. Consequently $T'_{\bfZ}/\pi(T_{\bfZ})$ is isomorphic to the kernel of $\pi:T_{\bfZ}\to T'_{\bfZ}$, i.e. to $Z(L)$, which ends the proof of \eqref{art03-eq2}.

The determination of $\Aut L/\Int L$ is thus to a large extent reduced to that of the center $Z(L)$ of $L$, and of the quotient of $L$ by its commutator subgroup $(L,L)$. We now make some remarks on these two groups.

\setcounter{subsection}{3}
\subsection{}\label{art03-sec2.4}
The center $Z(L)$ of $L$ is of order two if $G$ is simply connected of type $\bfA_{n}$ ($n$ odd), $\bfB_{n}$, $\bfC_{n}(n\geq 1)$, $\bfD_{n}(n\geq 3, n\text{~odd})$, $\bfE_{7}$, of type (\ref{art03-sec2.2}) if $G={\boldmath\text{$\Spin$~}} 4m$ ($m$ positive integer), of order one in the other cases.

In fact the $\bfZ$-structure on $G$ may be defined by means of an admissible lattice in the representation space of a faithful representation defined over $\bfQ$. If we assume $G\subset \mathbf{GL}(n,\bfC)$ and $\bfZ^{n}$ to be an admissible lattice, then $Z(L)$ is represented by diagonal matrices with integral coefficients, which shows first that $Z(L)$ is an elementary abelian 2-group. All almost simple simply connected groups have faithful irreducible representations, except for the type $\bfD_{2m}$. Thus, except in that case, $Z(L)$ is of order 2 (resp. 1) if $Z(G)$ has even (resp. odd) order, whence our contention. The case of $\bfD_{2m}$ is settled by considering the sum of the two half-spinor representations.

\subsection{}\label{art03-sec2.5}
It is well known that $\textbf{SL}(n,\bfZ)$ is equal to its commutator subgroup if $n\geq 3$ (see \cite{art03-key3} e.g.). Also the commutator subgroup of $\mathbf{Sp}(2n,\bfZ)$ is equal to $\mathbf{Sp}(2n,\bfZ)$ if $n\geq 3$, has index two if $n=2$ \cite{art03-key3},\pageoriginale \cite{art03-key28}. More generally, if the congruence subgroup theorem holds, which is the case if $rkG\geq 2$ and $G$ is simply connected, according to \cite{art03-key22}, then $L/(L,L)$ is the product of the corresponding local groups $G_{0_{pp}}/(G_{0_{p}},G_{0_{p}})$. Serre has pointed out to me that, using this, one can show that $L=(L,L)$ if $G$ has $\rank \geq 3$, and is simply connected. Another more direct proof was mentioned to me by R. Stemberg, who also showed that $L/(L,L)$ is of order two if $G=\bfG_{2}$. He uses known commutation rules among unipotent elements of $L$, and the fact that they generate $L$.

\setcounter{theorem}{5}
\begin{examples}\label{art03-exams2.6}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] $G=\mathbf{SL}(n,\bfC)$, $L=\mathbf{SL}(n,\bfZ)$, $(n\geq 3)$. In this case, $E(G)$ is of order two, generated by the automorphism $\sigma:x\mapsto {}^{t}x^{-1}$. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem2.3} and \ref{art03-lem2.4}, $\Int L$ has index one (resp. two) in the image of $N(L)$ if $n$ is odd (resp. even). Furthermore, it is easily seen, and will follow from Lemma \ref{art03-lem4.5}, that, in the even dimensional case, the non-interior automorphisms defined by $N(L)$ are of the form $x\mapsto y\cdot x\cdot y^{-1}(y\in \mathbf{GL}(n,\bfZ), \det y=-1)$. Thus, taking \ref{art03-sec2.5} into account, we see that $\Aut L$ is generated by $\Int L$, $\sigma$, and, for $n$ even, by one further automorphism induced by an element of $\mathbf{GL}(n,\bfZ)$ of determinant ${}-1$. This is closely related to results of Hua-Reiner \cite{art03-key12}, \cite{art03-key13}.

\item[(2)] $G=\mathbf{Sp}(2n,\bfC)$, $L=\mathbf{Sp}(2n,\bfZ)$, $(n\geq 2)$. Here, $E(G)$ is reduced to the identity. Thus, by the above, $\Int L$ has index two in $\Aut L$ if $n\geq 3$, index four if $n=2$. The non-trivial element of $N(L)/L$ is represented by an automorphism of the form $x\mapsto y\cdot x\cdot y^{-1}$ where $y$ is an element of $\mathbf{GL}(2n,\bfZ)$ which transforms the bilinear form underlying the definition of $\mathbf{Sp}(2n,\bfC)$ into its opposite (see Examples \ref{art03-exams4.6}). For $n=2$, one has to add the automorphism $x\to \chi(x)\cdot x$, where $\chi$ is the non-trivial character of $L$. This result is due to Reiner \cite{art03-key27}.

\item[(3)] $G$ is simply connected, of type $\bfD_{2m}$. Then we have a composition series
$$
\Aut L\supset A\supset \Int L,
$$
where $\Aut L/A$ is of order two, and $A/\Int L$ has order two if $m$ is odd, is of type (\ref{art03-thm2.2}) if $m$ is even. This follows from (\ref{art03-thm2.2}), (\ref{art03-lem2.3}), (\ref{art03-sec2.4}), (\ref{art03-sec2.5}). The other simple groups of $\rank \geq 3$ are discussed similarly.

\section{$S$-arithmetic groups over number fields}\label{art03-sec3}
\pageoriginale

\subsection{}\label{art03-sec3.1}

Throughout the rest of this paper, $k$ is an algebraic number field of finite degree over $\bfQ$, $\mathfrak{o}$ its ring of integers, $V$ the set of primes of $k$, $V_{\infty}$ the set of infinite primes of $k$, $S$ a finite subset of $V$ containing $V_{\infty}$, and $\mathfrak{o}(S)$ the subring of $x\in k$ which are integral outside $S$. We let $I(k,S)$ be the $S$-ideal class group of $k$, i.e. the quotient of the group of fractional $\mathfrak{o}(S)$-ideals by the group of principal $\mathfrak{o}(S)$-ideals. We follow the notation of \cite{art03-key5}. In particular $k_{v}$ is the completion of $k$ at $v\in S$, $\mathfrak{o}_{v}$ the ring of integers of $k_{v}$. If $G$ is a $k$-group, then $G^{0}$ is its identity component, and 
$$
G_{v}=G_{k_{v}}(v\in S), G_{S}=\prod\limits_{v\in S}G_{v}, G_{\infty}=\prod\limits_{v\in V_{\infty}}G_{v}.
$$
Moreover $G'=R_{k/\bfQ}G$ is the group obtained from $G$ by restriction of the groundfiled from $k$ to $\bfQ$(\cite{art03-key31}, Chap. I), and we let $\mu$ denote the canonical isomorphism of $G_{k}$ onto $G'_{\bfQ}$.

If $A$ is an abelian group, and $q$ a positive integer, we let ${}_{q}A$ and $A^{(q)}$ denote the kernel and the image of the homomorphism $x\mapsto x^{q}$.

\subsection{}\label{art03-sec3.2}
Let $G$ be a $k$-group. A subgroup $L$ of $G_{k}$ is $S$-arithmetic if there is a faithful $k$-morphism $r:G\to \mathbf{GL}_{n}$ such that $r(L)$ is commensurable with $r(G)_{\mathfrak{o}(S)}$.

If $S'$ is a finite set of primes of $\bfQ$, including $\infty$, and $S$ is the set of primes dividing some element of $S'$, then $v:G_{k}\xrightarrow{\sim}G'_{\bfQ}$ induces a bijection between $S$-arithmetic subgroups of $G$ and $S'$-arithmetic subgroups of $G'$. This follows directly from the remarks made in (\cite{art03-key5}, \S1).

In the following proposition, we collect some obvious generalizations of known facts.

\setcounter{theorem}{2}
\begin{proposition}\label{prop3.3}
Let $G$ be a semi-simple $k$-group, $L$ a $S$-arithmetic subgroup of $G$, $N$ the greatest normal $k$-subgroup of $G^{0}$ such that $N_{\infty}$ is compact, and $\pi:G\to G/N$ the natural projection.
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\rm(a)}] If $N$ is finite and $G$ is connected, $L$ is Zariski-dense in $G$.
\item[{\rm(b)}] If $G$ is connected, the commensurability group $C(L)$ of $L$ in $G$ is equal to $\pi^{-1}((G/N)_{k})$.
\item[{\rm(c)}] If\pageoriginale $\sigma:G\to H$ is a surjective $k$-morphism, $\sigma(L)$ is $S$-arithmetic in $H$.

\item[{\rm(d)}] If $N$ is finite, $L$ has finite index in its normalizer in $G$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] follows from (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 3), and from the fact that $L$ contains an arithmetic subgroup of $G$.

\item[(b)] We recall that $C(L)$ is the group of elements $x\in G$ such that $x\cdot L\cdot x^{-1}$ is commensurable with $L$. The proof of (b) is the same as that the Theorem 2 in \cite{art03-key6}. In fact, this argument shows that if $G$ is centerless, then $C(M)\subset G_{k}$ whenever $M$ is a subgroup of $G_{k}$ Zariski-dense in $G$.

\item[(c)] If $\sigma$ is an isomorphism, the argument is the same as that of (\cite{art03-key7}, \S6.3). If $\sigma$ is an isogeny, this has been proved in (\cite{art03-key5}, \S8.12). From there, the extension to the general case proceeds exactly in the same way as in the case $S=V_{\infty}$(\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 6).

\item[(d)] We may assume $G$ to be connected and $N=\{e\}$. Then by (c), $N(L)\subset G_{k}$. We view $G_{k}$ and $L$ as diagonally embedded in $G_{S}$. Then $L$ is discrete in $G_{S}$.
\end{itemize}

This group $L$ has a finite system of generators \cite{art03-key17}, say $(x_{i})_{1\leq i\leq q}$. Since $L$ is discrete, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $e$ in $G_{S}$ such that if $x\in N(L)\cap U$, then $x$ centralizes the $x_{i}$'s, hence $L$. The latter being Zariski-dense in $G$, this implies that the component $x_{v}$ of $x$ in $G_{v}(v\in S)$ is central in $G_{v}$, whence $x_{v}=e$, which shows that $N(L)$ is discrete in $G_{S}$. But $G_{S}/L$ has finite invariant volume (\cite{art03-key5}, \S5.6) and is fibered by $N(L)/L$, hence $N(L)/L$ is finite.

\begin{proposition}\label{art03-prop3.4}
Let $G$ be a semi-simple $k$-group, $L$ a subgroup of $G_{k}$ which is Zariski-dense, and is equal to its normalizer in $G_{k}$, and $N(L)$ the normalizer of $L$ in $G$. Then $N(L)/L$ is a commutative group whose exponent divides the order $m$ of the center $Z(G)$ of $G$.
\end{proposition}

We show first that if $x\in N(L)$, then $x^{m}\in L$. In view of the assumption, it suffices to prove that $x^{m}\in G_{k}$. Let $\pi:G\to G/Z(G)$ be the canonical projection. The fiber $F_{x}=\pi^{-1}(\pi(x))$ of $x$ consists of the elements $x\cdot z_{i}(1\leq i\leq m)$, where $z_{i}$ runs through $Z(G)$, and belongs to $N(L)$. By the remark made in Proposition \ref{art03-prop3.3}(b), $\pi(x)$ is rational over\pageoriginale $k$, hence $F_{x}$ is defined over $k$, and its points are permuted by the Galois group of $\overline{k}$ over $k$. Since the $z_{i}$'s are central, the product of the $xz_{i}$ is equal to $x^{m}\cdot z_{1}\ldots z_{m}$ and is rational over $k$. Similarly the product of the $z_{i}$'s is rational over $k$, whence our assertion.

It is possible to embed $Z(G)$ as a $k$-subgroup in a $k$-torus $T'$ whose first Galois cohomology group is zero (see Ono, Annals of Math. (2), 82 (1965), p. 96). Let $H=(G\times T')/Z(G)$ where $Z(G)$ is embedded diagonally in $G\times T'$. Then $G/Z(G)$ may be identified with $H/T'$. Let $x\in N(L)$. We have already seen that $\pi(x)$ is rational over $k$. But, since $T'$ has trivial first Galois-cohomology group, the map $H_{k}\to (H/T')_{k}$ is surjective. There exists therefore $d\in T'$ such that $d\cdot x\in H_{k}$. Thus, if $x$, $y\in N(L)$, we can find two elements $x'$, $y'\in H_{k}$, which normalize $L$, whose commutator $(x',y')$ is equal to $(x,y)$. But, obviously, $G=(H,H)$, therefore $(x,y)\in N(L)_{k}$ hence $(x,y)\in L$, and $(N(L),N(L))\subset L$. This argument also proves that
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
N(L)=G\cap (N_{H}(L)_{k}\cdot T'),\label{art03-prop3.4-eq1}
\end{equation}
where $N_{H}(L)$ is the normalizer of $L$ in $H$, and $N_{H}(L)_{k}=N_{H}(L)\cap H_{k}$.

For the sake of reference, we state as a lemma a remark made by Ihara in (\cite{art03-key14}, p. 269).

\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem3.5}
Let $A$ be a group, $B$ a subgroup, and $V$ a $A$-module. Assume that for any $a\in A$, there is no non-zero element of $V$ fixed under $a\cdot B\cdot a^{-1}\cap B$. Then the restriction map $r:H^{1}(A,V)\to H^{1}(B,V)$ is injective.
\end{lemma}

If suffices to show that if $z$ is a 1-cocycle of $A$ which is zero on $B$, then $z$ is zero. Let $a\in A$, $b\in B$ be such that $a\cdot b\cdot a^{-1}=b'\in B$. We have then
$$
z(a\cdot b)=z(a)=z(b'\cdot a)=b'\cdot z(a),
$$
which shows that $z(a)$ is fixed under $a\cdot B\cdot a^{-1}\cap B$, hence is zero.

\begin{theorem}\label{art03-thm3.6}
Let $G$ be a semi-simple $k$-group and $L$ a $S$-arithmetic subgroup. Then $E(L)$ is finite if one of the following conditions is fulfilled~:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\rm(a)}] $G$ has no normal $k$-subgroup $N$ such that $N_{\infty}$ has a non-compact factor of type $\mathbf{SL}(2,\bfR)$, or also of type $\mathbf{SL}(2,\bfC)$ if $G_{S}/L$ is not compact;

\item[{\rm(b)}] $G$\pageoriginale is of type $\mathbf{SL}_{2}$ over $k$, and $S$ has at least two elements.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}(b), we may assume $G$ to be connected. Let $N$ be the greatest normal $k$-subgroup of $G$ such that $N_{\infty}$ is compact and $\pi:G\to G/N$ the natural projection.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Arguing as in Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}, we see that it suffices to show that $E(\pi(L))$ is finite, which reduces us to the case where $G$ is a direct product of simple $k$-groups $G_{i}$. The group $L_{i}=G_{i}\cap L$ is $S$-arithmetic in $G_{i}$ and the product of the $L_{i}$ is normal of finite index in $L$. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.4}, we may therefore assume $L$ to be the product of its intersection with the $G_{i}$'s. The group $L$ has finite index in its normalizer (Proposition \ref{art03-prop3.3}) and is finitely generated \cite{art03-key17}, so that, in order to deduce our assertion from Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.1}, applied to $L$ and $G_{\infty}$, it suffices to show that $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})=0$. Since this group is isomorphic to the product of the groups $H^{1}(L_{i},\mathfrak{g}_{i\infty})$, we may assume $G$ to be simple over $k$. Let $L_{0}=L\cap G_{\mathfrak{o}}$.

The group $L_{0}$ is arithmetic, and therefore so is $x\cdot L_{0}\cdot x^{-1}\cap L_{0}=L_{0,x}(x\in L)$. Consequently, $L_{0,x}$ is Zariski-dense in $G$ (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 1), and has no non-zero fixed vector in $\mathfrak{g}_{\infty}$. By Lemma \ref{art03-lem3.5}, the restriction map : $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})\to H^{1}(L_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})$ is injective. But $H^{1}(L_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})=0$: if $\rk_{k}G\geq 1$, this follows from \cite{art03-key25}, \cite{art03-key26}. Let now $\rk_{k}G=0$. Then $G_{\infty}/L_{0}$ is compact (\cite{art03-key4}, \S11.6). In view of \ref{art03-sec3.2}, we may further assume $G$ to be almost absolutely simple over $k$. Let $J$ be the set of $v\in V_{\infty}$ such that $G_{v}$ is not compact and $H$ the subgroup of $G$ generated by the $G_{v}$'s $(v\in J)$. Then, by Weil's theorem (\cite{art03-key32}, \cite{art03-key33}),
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{h}=0.\label{art03-thm3.6-eq1}
\end{equation}
But we have
\begin{equation}
H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{v})=H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},{}^{v}\mathfrak{g}_{k})\otimes_{v(k)}k_{v},\quad (v\in V_{\infty})\label{art03-thm3.6-eq2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{g})=\prod\limits_{v\in V_{\infty}}H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{v}),\label{art03-thm3.6-eq3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{h})=\prod\limits_{v\in J}H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{v}),\label{art03-thm3.6-eq4}
\end{equation}
whence $H^{1}(\Gamma_{0},\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})=0$.

\item[(b)] $N$\pageoriginale is finite, and therefore, $L$ has finite index in its normalizer (Proposition \ref{art03-prop3.3}). Again, there remains to show that $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})=0$. Let $\mathbf{SL}_{2}\to G$ be the covering map, and $L'$ the inverse image of $L$ in $\mathbf{SL}(2,k)$. The homomorphism $H^{1}(L,\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})\to H^{1}(L',\mathfrak{g}_{\infty})$ is injective, hence we may assume $G=\mathbf{SL}_{2}$. But then the vanishing of $H^{1}$ follows from \cite{art03-key29}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark*}
It is also true that in both cases of Theorem \ref{art03-thm3.6}, the group $L$ is not isomorphic to a proper subgroup of finite index. This is seen by modifying the proof of Theorem \ref{art03-thm3.6}, in the same way as Proposition \ref{art03-prop1.7} was obtained from Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.5}.
\end{remark*}

If $G$ is almost simple over $k$, of $k$-rank $\geq 2$, then we may apply Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.9} to $G'$. Thus, in that case, we see that, if $L$ contains $Z(G)_{k}$, the determination of $\Aut L$ is essentially reduced to that of the normalizer of $L$ in $G$, of the homomorphisms of $L$ into its center, and of the exterior automorphisms of $G'$ leaving stable. We shall use this in \S4 to get more explicit information when $G$ is a split group. Here, we mention another consequence of Theorem \ref{art03-thm1.9}.

\begin{proposition}\label{art03-prop3.7}
Let $G$ be an almost absolutely simple $k$-group, of $k$-rank $\geq 2$, $k'$ a number field, and $G'$ an almost absolutely simple $k'$-group. Let $L$ be an arithmetic subgroup of $G_{k}$, and $s$ an isomorphism of $L$ onto an arithmetic subgroup of $G'$. Then there is an isomorphism $\phi$ of $k'$ onto $k$ and the $k$-group ${}^{\phi}G'$ obtained from $G'$ by change of the groundfield $\phi$ is $k$-isogeneous to $G$.
\end{proposition}

Let $H=R_{k/\bfQ}G$, $H'=R_{k'/\bfQ}G'$, and $M$, $M'$ the images of $L$ and $L'=s(L)$ under the canonical isomorphisms $G_{k}\xrightarrow{\sim}H_{\bfQ}$ and $G'_{k'}\xrightarrow{\sim}H'_{\bfQ}$.

Then $s$ may be viewed as an isomorphism of $M$ onto $M'$. The group $M'$ is infinite, hence $H'_{\bfR}$ is not compact, and $M'$ is Zariski-dense in $H'$ (\cite{art03-key6}, Theorem 1). By Lemma \ref{art03-lem1.8}, $H$ and $H'$ are $\bfQ$-isogeneous. There exists therefore an isomorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathfrak{h}_{\bfQ}$ onto $\mathfrak{h}'_{\bfQ}$. But the commuting algebra of $\ad\mathfrak{h}_{\bfQ}$ (resp. $\ad\mathfrak{h}'_{\bfQ}$) in the ring of linear transformations of $\mathfrak{h}_{\bfQ}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{h}'_{\bfQ}$) into itself is isomorphic to $k$ (resp. $k'$). Hence $\alpha$ induces an isomorphism $\phi:k'\xrightarrow{\sim}k$. Let $\mathfrak{g}''_{k}={}^{\phi}\mathfrak{g}_{k'}$ be the Lie algebra over $k$ obtained from $\mathfrak{g}'$ by the change of ground-field\pageoriginale $\phi$. Then, it is clear from the definition of $\phi$ that $\alpha=R_{k/\bfQ}\beta$, where $\beta$ is a $k$-isomorphism of $\mathfrak{g}$ onto $\mathfrak{g}''$. This isomorphism is then the differential of a $k$-isogeny of the universal covering of $G$ onto the $k$-group ${}^{\phi}G'$.

\setcounter{subsection}{7}
\subsection{}\label{art03-sec3.8} 
We need some relations between $(\Aut G)_{k}$ and $(\Aut G')_{\bfQ}$. For simplicity, we establish them in the context of Lie algebras, and assume $G$ to be almost simple over $\overline{k}$. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}$ is just $\mathfrak{g}_{k}$, viewed as a Lie algebra over $\bfQ$. Since $\mathfrak{g}_{k}$ is absolutely simple, the commuting algebra of $\ad\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}$ in $\mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ})$ may be identified to $k$. Let $a\in \Aut \mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}$. Then $a$ defines an automorphism of $\mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ})$ leaving $\ad\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}$ stable, and therefore an automorphism $\beta(a)$ of $k$. If $\beta$ is the identity, this means that $a$ is a $k$-linear map of $\mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}$, hence comes from an automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}_{k}$. We have therefore an exact sequence
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
1\to \Aut \mathfrak{g}_{k}\to \Aut \mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}\to \Aut k.\label{art03-sec3.8-eq1}
\end{equation}

Let $k_{0}$ be the fixed field of $\Aut k$ in $k$. Assume that $\mathfrak{g}_{k}=\mathfrak{g}_{0}\otimes_{k_{0}}k$, where $\mathfrak{g}_{0}$ is a Lie algebra over $k_{0}$. Then, for $s\in \Aut k$, ${}^{s}\mathfrak{g}_{k}=\mathfrak{g}_{k}$, and $s$, acting by conjugation with respect to $\mathfrak{g}_{0}$, defines a $s$-linear automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}_{k}$, and therefore an automorphism $a$ of $\Aut \mathfrak{g}_{\bfQ}$ such that $\beta(a)=s$. Thus, in this case, the sequence
\begin{equation}
1\to \Aut \mathfrak{g}_{k}\to \Aut \mathfrak{g}'_{\bfQ}\to \Aut k\to 1\label{art03-sec3.8-eq2}
\end{equation}
is exact and split. Translated into group terms, this yields the following lemma:

\setcounter{theorem}{8}
\begin{lemma}\label{art03-lem3.9}
Let $G$ be absolutely almost simple over $k$. Then we have an exact sequence
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
1\to (\Aut G)_{k}\to (\Aut G')_{\bfQ}\to \Aut k.\label{art03-lem3.9-eq1}
\end{equation}
Let $k_{0}$ be the fixed field of $\Aut k$ and assume that $G$ is obtained by extension of the field of definition from a $k_{0}$-group $G_{0}$. Then the sequence
\begin{equation}
1\to (\Aut G)_{k}\to (\Aut G')_{\bfQ}\to \Aut k\to 1\label{art03-lem3.9-eq2}
\end{equation}
is exact and split. On $G_{k}$, identified with $G_{0,k}$, the group $\Aut k$ acts by conjugation.
\end{lemma}
