\chapter{Introduction}


We shall consider some heterogeneous topics relating to Lie groups and
the general theory of representations of locally compact groups. The
first part exclusively deals with some elementary facts about Lie
groups and the last two parts are entirely independent of the material
contained in the first. We have rigidly adhered to the analytic
approach in establishing the relations between Lie groups and Lie
algebras. Thus we do not need the theory of distributions on a
manifold or the existence of integral manifolds for an involutory
distribution. 

The second part concerns itself only with the general theory of
measures on a locally compact group and representations in
general. Only a passing reference is made to distributions (in the
sense of L. Schwartz), and induced representations are not treated in
detail. 

In the third part, we first construct the continuous sum ('the direct
integral') of Hilbert spaces and then decompose a unitary
representations into a continuous sum of irreducible
representations. We derive the Plancherel formula for a separable
unimodular group in terms of factorial representations and derive the
classical formula in the abelian case.
