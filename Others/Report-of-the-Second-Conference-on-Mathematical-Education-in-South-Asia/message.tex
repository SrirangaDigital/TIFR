\textbf{\Large{MESSAGE}}
\end{center}

I am glad to learn that the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research has
organised an International Colloquium on Function Theory as well as a
conference on Mathematical Education in South Asia. This Colloquium is
of high importance as the most eminent mathematicians from other
countries are attending it. I should like to extend a warm welcome to
them not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of the Government
of India.


The study of mathematics has always been of great importance. Today
its importance has increased even more and it has become the basis of
the great advances that science has made in recent years. I am sure
that the International Colloquium that is going to be held in Bombay
in the presence of so many eminent mathematicians will advance the
cause of both mathematical research and science. I wish it success.
