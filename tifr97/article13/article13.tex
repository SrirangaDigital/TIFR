We consider a bounded symmetric complex domain $B$ in the sense of Elie Cartan\footnote{See for instance Siegel \cite{art13-key5}, Chapter XI.} and denote the group of analytic mappings of $B$ onto itself by $G$, points in $B$ by $z$ and the elements of $G$ by $g:z\to gz$. By a multiplier (or automorphy factor) $\rho_{g}(z)$, we understand a function defined on $G\times B$ which is analytic (holomorphic) in $z$ and differentiable in $g$ such that
\begin{equation}
\rho_{g_{1}g_{2}}(z)=\rho_{g_{1}}(g_{2}z)\rho_{g_{2}}(z).\label{art13-eq1.1}
\end{equation}
Any such multiplier defines a kernel function $k_{\rho}(z,\overline{z})$ which transforms in the way
\begin{equation}
k_{\rho}(gz,\overline{gz})=\rho_{g}(z)\overline{\rho_{g}(z)}k_{p}(z,\overline{z}).\label{art13-eq1.2}
\end{equation}
We need only to write, for some fixed $z_{0}$ in $B$,
$$
k_{\rho}(z,\overline{z})=|\rho_{g}(z_{0})|^{2}
$$
where $g$ is a solution of $z=gz_{0}$ and it is clear that this does not depend on the particular $g$ chosen, but only on the point $z$.

From \eqref{art13-eq1.2}, we get that
$$
ds^{2}=\sum\limits_{i,j}\frac{\partial^{2}\log k_{p}(z,\overline{z})}{\partial z_{i}\partial\overline{z}_{j}}\cdot dz_{i}d\overline{z}_{j}
$$
is an invariant metric on $B$ under the action of the group $G$. Thus, if $B$ is irreducible, we get that this metric can differ only by a constant factor from the Bergmann metric. If $B$ is reducible, it must be a linear combination of the Bergmann metrics of the irreducible factors of $B$. For irreducible $B$, one easily derives that, up to a factor of the form $cf(z)\overline{f(z)}$ where $f(z)$ is analytic, $k_{\rho}(z,\overline{z})$ coincides with a real power of the Bergmann kernel function and $\rho_{g}(z)$ is, apart from a `trivial' multiplier of the form $f(gz)/f(z)$, equal to a power of the jacobian $j_{g}(z)$ of the mapping $g$. Similarly, if $B$ is reducible, $\rho_{g}(z)$ is, apart from a trivial factor $f(gz)/f(z)$, equal to a product of powers of the jacobians of the mapping $g$ with respect to the various irreducible factors of $B$. 

We\pageoriginale may mention that essentially the same conclusion could be drawn from the weaker premise that instead of \eqref{art13-eq1.1}, $\rho_{g}(z)$ satisfies the relation 
\begin{equation}
|\rho_{g_{1}g_{2}}(z)|=|\rho_{g_{1}}(g_{2}z)||\rho_{g_{2}}(z)|,
\end{equation}
then, apart from a factor of the form $\epsilon_{g}f(gz)/f(z)$ where $f$ is analytic and $|\epsilon_{g}|=1$, $\rho_{g}(z)$ is equal to a product of powers of the jacobians of the mapping $z\to gz$ with respect to the irreducible factors of $B$.

We shall study linear operators on functions defined on $B$, which have the property of transforming with a multiplier on each side under the mappings of the group $G$. Call the operator $L=L_{z}$ and define $L_{gz}$ through the relation
$$
L_{gz}F(z)=[L_{z}F(g^{-1}z)]_{z\to gz};
$$
then $L$ should transform according to the rule
\begin{equation}
L_{gz}=\rho_{g}(z)L_{2}\sigma^{-1}_{g}(z),\label{art13-eq1.4}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are two multipliers.\footnote{From now on, we disregard trivial multipliers and consider only products of powers of the jacobians for the irreducible factors of $B$. This is only an apparent restriction.}

We ask the question : for which $B$ and which choices of multipliers $\rho$ and $\sigma$ do such operators exist? And when they exist, determine their form as explicitly as possible.

It is easily seen that we may restrict ourselves to the case that $B$ is irreducible and then derive the results for the general case from those obtained for the irreducible factors of $B$ in case $B$ is irreducible.

As is known\footnote{See Siegel \cite{art13-key5}, Chapter XI for instance.} there are six types of irreducible bounded symmetric domains. If we denote a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns by $Z^{(m,n)}$ and the $(n,n)$ unit matrix $E$ or $E^{(n)}$, there are the four main types :
\begin{itemize}
\item[(I)] $Z=Z^{(m,n)}$, $E-\overline{Z}'Z>0$,

\item[(II)] $Z=Z^{(n,n)}$, $Z'=-Z$, $E-\overline{Z}'Z>0$.

\item[(III)] $Z=Z^{(n,n)}$, $Z'=Z$, $E-\overline{Z}'Z>0$,\quad and

\item[(IV)] $Z=Z^{(n,1)}$, $\overline{Z}'Z<\frac{1}{2}(1+|Z'Z|^{2})<1$.
\end{itemize}

Here $Z'$ denotes the transposed matrix. In addition, there are the types V and VI --- the two exceptional bounded symmetric domains of complex dimension 16 and 27 respectively; we shall not give a definition here.

It\pageoriginale should also be noted that for $n=2$, the domain IV is reducible and that there is also some overlapping between the four types for low dimension; the unit circle $|z|<1$ in one complex variable is, for instance, a special case of all the four types.

\section{}\label{art13-sec2}
The question of linear operators that transform according to the rule \eqref{art13-eq1.4} can be split in two :
\begin{itemize}
\item[({\em a})] Operators that conserve the multiplier, i.e. when \eqref{art13-eq1.4} holds, but with $\rho_{g}(z)\equiv \sigma_{g}(z)$.
\end{itemize}

We shall refer to such operators as invariant (though, strictly speaking, they are so only if $\rho_{g}(z)\equiv 1$ identically).

It is well-known that invariant operators exist for all the bounded symmetric domains $B$ and for all multipliers $\rho_{g}(z)$; for given $\rho$ the differential operators form a finitely generated ring, where the number of independent generators equals the rank of the group $G$ (or of the symmetric space). In this ring, all elements, except the constant, contain differentiations both with respect to $z$ and $\overline{z}$. The form of integral operators is easily given explicitly for $B$ irreducible; if $\rho_{g}(z)=(j_{g}(z))^{-r}$ where $j_{g}(z)$ denotes the jacobian of the mapping $g$, then
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
Lf=\int\limits_{B} x(z,\zeta)\left(\frac{k(z,\overline{\eta})}{k(\zeta,\overline{\zeta})}\right)^{r}f(\zeta)d\omega_{\zeta}\label{art13-eq2.1}
\end{equation}
where $d\omega_{\zeta}$ is the invariant volume element, $k(z,\overline{\zeta})$ is the Bergmann kernel function and $x(z,\zeta)$ is a ``point pair invariant'' satisfying $x(gz,g\zeta)=x(z,\zeta)$ for all $z$ and $\zeta$ in $B$ and $g$ in $G$.

In particular, for analytic functions $f(z)$, we have the reproducing operator
\begin{equation}
f(z)=c_{r}\int\limits_{B}\left(\frac{k(z,\overline{\zeta})}{k(\zeta,\overline{\zeta})}\right)^{r}f(\zeta)d\omega_{\zeta}\label{art13-eq2.2}
\end{equation}
where $c_{r}$ is a certain polynomial in $r$. \eqref{art13-eq2.2} is valid for a certain hilbertspace of analytic functions if $r>r_{0}$, the largest zero of the polynomial $c_{r}$.\footnote{See Selberg \cite{art13-key4}} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[({\em b})] Operators that change the multiplier, i.e. which transform in the way \eqref{art13-eq1.4} but with $\rho_{g}(z)\nequiv \sigma_{g}(z)$.
\end{itemize}

The question ({\em b}) is more complex than ({\em a}), but it is not difficult to establish that linear operators that change the multiplier do not exist for all the irreducible domains, but only for a certain subclass.

To see this, we may look at the compact subgroup of $G$ which leaves some\pageoriginale point $z_{0}$ in $B$ fixed, the so-called stability group or isotropy group of $z_{0}$. It is simplest to choose the point $O$ where all the coordinates are zero and the compact subgroup $K_{0}$ which keeps $O$ fixed. For all the six types of bounded symmetric domains, the way they are usually defined, the elements of $K_{0}$ are linear transformations, and $K_{0}$ is essentially (sometimes, a slight change of variables being necessary as in type III where we would put a factor $1/\sqrt{2}$ in the elements of the symmetric matrix which are off the main diagonal) a subgroup of the unitary group $U(N)$ where $N$ is the complex dimension of $B$ and $j_{k}(z)=j_{k}(0)$, where $k\in K_{0}$, is a one-dimensional representation of $K_{0}$.

It is clear that if there exists a linear operator satisfying \eqref{art13-eq1.4}, then, in particular, \eqref{art13-eq1.4} must hold for $g$ restricted to $K_{0}$ and we consider the functional $\mathscr{L}$ that $L_{z}$ represents at $z=0$.

On the other hand, it is not hard to show that if we have a linear functional $\mathscr{L}$ which has the required property \eqref{art13-eq1.4} for $g$ in $K_{0}$, then it can be extended to a linear operator $L_{z}$ by means of the relation \eqref{art13-eq1.4} with $z=gO$, but the general form of this operator seems awkward to obtain in this way, particularly if it is a differential operator.

It is easily seen that an integral operator
$$
L_{z}f=\int\limits_{B}h(z,\zeta) f(\zeta)d\omega_{\zeta}
$$
where $h(z,\zeta)$ is a short form for $h(z,\overline{z},\zeta,\overline{\zeta})$, must in order to satisfy \eqref{art13-eq1.4}, have a kernel $h(z,\zeta)$ which satisfies
\begin{equation}
h(gz,g\zeta)=\rho_{g}(z)\sigma^{-1}_{g}(\zeta)h(z,\zeta)\label{art13-eq2.3}
\end{equation}
and, in particular, for $g=k\in K_{0}$, if we put $\zeta=0$, we get
$$
h(kz,0)=\rho_{k}(z)\sigma^{-1}_{k}(0)h(z,0)
$$
or since $\rho_{k}(z)=\rho_{k}(0)$,
\begin{equation}
h(kz,0)=\rho_{k}(0)\sigma^{-1}_{k}(0)h(z,0).\label{art13-eq2.4}
\end{equation}
Since we may assume that $h(z,\zeta)$ is analytic in $z$ and $z$\footnote{If our original $h(z,\zeta)$ is not so, we may form the convolution of $L_{z}$ with a suitable operator of the form \eqref{art13-eq2.1} on the left which preserves the multiplier $\rho_{g}(z)$.}, it is clear that the expansion of $h(z,0)$ in terms of powers of $z$ and $\overline{z}$ for $z$ near $0$, must start with a homogeneous polynomial $\rho(z,\overline{z})$ which also transforms by the factor $\rho_{k}(0)\sigma^{-1}_{k}(0)$ when we replace $z$ by $kz$.

Similarly,\pageoriginale if $D_{z}$ is a differential operator which obeys the transformation rule \eqref{art13-eq1.4}, at $z=0$ it takes the form of a polynomial in $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}}$:
$$
D_{0}=P\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z},\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}}\right).
$$
When $z$ and so $dz$ undergoes a unitary transformation from $K_{0}$, $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}$ undergoes the contragredient transformation; so we are again led to a polynomial (which we may assume to be homogeneous, otherwise taking the homogeneous part of lowest degree that is not identically zero) which transforms in the way \eqref{art13-eq2.4} when the variables undergo the contragredient transformation to $k$ (Actually, if we interchange $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}}$, the vector $\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}},\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)$ undergoes the same transformation as $(z,\overline{z})$).

It is now easy to see for the various types of $B$ whether such polynomials exist when $\rho_{g}(z)\nequiv \sigma_{g}(z)$.

{\em We find that for type I, they exist only if $m=n$ and are then of the form}
$$
|z|^{r}P(z,\overline{z})\quad\text{or}\quad |\overline{z}|^{r}P(z,\overline{z})
$$
{\em where $|z|$ is the determinant of $z$, $r$ some positive integer and $P(z,\overline{z})$ some homogeneous polynomial which is invariant under $K_{0}$.}

{\em For type II, they exist only if $n$ is even and are then of the form}
$$
P^{r}_{f}(z)P(z,\overline{z}\quad\text{or}\quad P^{r}_{f}(\overline{z})P(z,\overline{z})
$$
{\em where $P_{f}(z)$ is the polynomial called the Pfaffian of $z$ (actually $|z|^{1/2}$, since the determinant is a square in this case), $r$ again is a positive integer and $P$, a homogeneous polynomial which is invariant under $K_{0}$.}

{\em For type III, they exist for all $n$ and are of the form}
$$
|z|^{r}P(z,\overline{z})\quad\text{or}\quad |\overline{z}|^{r}P(z,\overline{z})
$$
{\em where $r$ is a positive integer and $P(z,\overline{z})$ homogeneous and invariant under $K_{0}$.}

{\em For type IV, they again exist and are of the form}
$$
(z' \ z)^{r}P(z,\overline{z})\quad\text{or}\quad (\overline{z}' \ \overline{z})^{r}P(z,\overline{z})
$$
{\em with $r$ a positive integer and $P(z,\text{\st{$z$}})$ again homogeneous and invariant under $K_{0}$.}

For\pageoriginale the types V and VI which (for good reason!) we have not exhibited explicitly, we find they do not exist for type V but, {\em for type} VI, {\em they exist and are given by the form}
$$
p_{3}(z)^{r}P(z,\overline{z})\quad\text{\em or}\quad p_{3}(\overline{z})^{r}P(z,\overline{z})
$$
{\em where $r$ and $P$ are as before and $p_{3}$ is a certain cubic polynomial in $27$ variables.}

\section{}\label{art13-sec3}
In order to derive more explicitly the form of the linear operators that transform according to \eqref{art13-eq1.4} in the cases where we have seen they can exist, we note that the cases we have listed in the previous section are precisely the cases when the bounded domain $B$, by a suitable analytic mapping, becomes a so-called ``positive half-space''\footnote{M. Koecher \cite{art13-key2} writes ``half-space''; I prefer ``positive half-space'' since it indicates the connection with a positivity-domain.}, and when the group $G$ by this mapping, becomes a real group (by which we mean that in this new unbounded version of our domain, we have $\overline{gz}=g\overline{z}$).

By a positive half-space, we understand a domain of $z=x+iy$, where the column vector $x$ is unrestricted, while the vector $y$ is required to lie in a homogeneous positivity-domain $Y$ in the sense of Koecher\footnote{M. Koecher \cite{art13-key1}}. As before, we shall use $N$ to denote the complex dimension.

We recall some of the properties of a homogeneous positivity domain $Y$. It is a cone such that, for any two vectors $y^{(1)}$ and $y^{(2)}$ in $Y$, we have always 
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\footnotetext[8]{Koecher's definition is more general; he has \eqref{art13-eq3.1} in the form $y^{(1)}Sy^{(2)}>0$, where $S$ is a nonsingular symmetric real matrix, but \eqref{art13-eq3.1} covers the cases we consider.}
\begin{equation}
y^{(1)}y^{(2)}>0\footnotemark[8]\label{art13-eq3.1}
\end{equation}
and so that if, for some vector $y^{(1)}$, \eqref{art13-eq3.1} holds for all $y^{(2)}$ in $Y$, then $y^{(1)}$ also lies in $Y$.

There also exists a group $G_{Y}$ of real matrices $A$ such that $y\to Ay$ maps $Y$ onto itself; this group is transitive on $Y$. In particular, for any scalar $\lambda>0$, we have $\lambda y\in Y$ for $y\in Y$, so that $Y$ is a cone. It is seen from \eqref{art13-eq3.1} that if $A$ is in $G_{Y}$, then $y\to {A'}^{-1}y$ also maps $Y$ onto itself; so, we may, without restriction, assume that with $A$, always ${A'}^{-1}$ also lies in $G_{Y}$.

There exists a homogeneous polynomial $Q(y)$, which we choose to be of minimal degree $q>0$ such that $Q(y)$ is positive in $Y$ and 
\footnotetext[9]{Our $Q(y)=(N(y))^{q/N}$, where $N(.)$ is Koecher's ``Norm-function''.}
\begin{equation}
Q(Ay)=|A|^{q/N}Q(y)\footnotemark[9]\label{art13-eq3.2}
\end{equation}\pageoriginale
If we define for $i=1,\ldots,N$,\footnotemark[9]
\begin{equation}
y^{*}_{i}=\dfrac{\partial \log Q(y)}{\partial y_{i}},\label{art13-eq3.3}
\end{equation}
then $y\to y^{*}$ is an involution which carries $Y$ into itself. We have\footnotemark[9]
\begin{equation}
Q(y^{*})Q(y)=\text{constant},\label{art13-eq3.4}
\end{equation}
and, by a suitable choice of $Q$ (which by \eqref{art13-eq3.2} is only determined up to a constant factor) we get
\begin{equation*}
Q(y^{*})Q(y)=1\tag{3.4$'$}\label{art13-eq3.4'}
\end{equation*}

Also, \eqref{art13-eq3.2} gives $y^{*'}y=q$ and $(A \ y)^{*}={A'}^{-1}y^{*}$.

On $Y$, we have an invariant volume element
\begin{equation}
dV_{y}=(Q(y)^{-N/q}dy\label{art13-eq3.5}
\end{equation}
where we have written $dy$ for the euclidean volume element. We also have an invariant metric
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=-\sum\limits_{1\leq i, j\leq N}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y_{i}\partial y_{j}}\log Q(y) dy_{i}dy_{j}.
\end{equation}
The involution $y\to y^{*}$ (which is actually a symmetry) has a fixed point $e$ and we have $Q(e)=1$.

Now consider the positive half-space of $z=x+iy$ where $x$ is unrestricted and $y$ is in $Y$ and the group generated by translations of the form $z\to z+a$ where $a$ is a real vector, $z\to Az$ for $A$ in $G_{Y}$ and $z\to z^{*}$ where
$$
z_{i}^{*}=-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z_{i}}\log Q(z),\text{~~ for~~ } i=1,\ldots,N.
$$
We call this group $G$.

If we write
\begin{equation}
D_{z}=Q\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right),\label{art13-eq3.7}
\end{equation}
we shall show that for $g$ in $G$,
\begin{equation}
D^{r}_{gz}=(j_{g}(z)^{-(1/2)(rq/N+1)}D^{r}_{z}(j_{g}(z))^{-(1/2)(rq/N-1)}\label{art13-eq3.8}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is any positive integer. If $gz=z+a$, \eqref{art13-eq3.8} is obvious and also for $gz=Az$ with $A$ in $G_{Y}$ so we really need to prove \eqref{art13-eq3.8} only for $gz=z^{*}$.

To do this, we first look at the $Y$ space. Actually $Y$ is a symmetric space; for any two points $y^{(1)}$ and $y^{(2)}$ in $Y$, there exists an $A$ in $G_{Y}$ such that $Ay^{(1)}=y^{(2)*}$,\pageoriginale $Ay^{(2)}=y^{(1)*}$. Thus $G_{Y}$ and the $*$ operation satisfy the conditions for $G$ and $\mu$ in Selberg \cite{art13-key3}.\footnote[10]{See Selberg \cite{art13-key10}, p. 51.} 

Also, we see that if $r$ is a positive integer, then
\begin{equation}
L_{y}=Q^{r}(y)Q^{r}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)\label{art13-eq3.9}
\end{equation}
is an operator invariant under the group $G_{Y}$.

It follows from a general result\footnote[11]{See Selberg \cite{art13-key3}, top of p. 53. In the context given there, the proof is obvious.} that under the $*$ operation the operator $L$ given by \eqref{art13-eq3.9} goes into the formal adjoint $L^{*}$ with respect to the invariant measure $dV_{y}$ or otherwise expressed
$$
L_{v^{*}}=L^{*}_{y}
$$
Thus for two suitable functions $f$ and $g$, we have
$$
\int\limits_{Y}f(y)L_{y}g(y)(Q(y))^{-N/q}dy=\int\limits_{Y}g(y)L^{*}_{y}f(y)(Q(y))^{-N/q}dy.
$$
Inserting the expression for $L$, we see that it is easy to find the formal adjoint $L^{*}$, since the formal adjoint of $Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$ with respect to the euclidean measure is $Q^{r}\left(-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)=(-1)^{rq}Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$. We get
\begin{align*}
\int\limits_{Y}f(y)Lg(y)(Q(y))^{-N/q}dy &= \int\limits_{Y}f(y)(Q(y)^{r-N/q}Q^{r}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)g(y)dy\\[3pt]
&= \int\limits_{Y}g(y)Q^{r}\left(-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)(Q(y))^{r-N/q}f(y)dy\\[3pt]
&= \int\limits_{Y}g(y)\left(Q(y)^{N/q}Q^{r}\left(-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)Q(y)^{r-N/q}f(y)\right)\times{}\\
&\quad \times \frac{dy}{(Q(y))^{N/q}}.
\end{align*}
Thus
$$
L^{*}=Q^{N/q}(y)Q^{r}\left(-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)Q^{r-N/q}(y).
$$
Also\pageoriginale
\begin{align*}
L^{*} &= Q^{r}(y^{*})Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y^{*}}\right)\\
&= Q^{-r}(y)Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y^{*}}\right).
\end{align*}
Comparing these two expressions for $L^{*}$, we get
\begin{align}
Q^{r}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y^{*}}\right) &= Q^{r+N.q}(y)Q^{r}\left(-\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)Q^{r-N/q}(y)\label{art13-eq3.10}\\
&= (-1)^{rq}Q^{r+N/q}(y)Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)Q^{r-N/q}(y).\notag
\end{align}
But, from \eqref{art13-eq3.10}, it follows immediately that
\begin{equation}
Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z^{*}}\right)=Q^{r+N/q}(z)Q^{r}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)Q^{r-N/q}(z).\label{art13-eq3.11}
\end{equation}
It remains to determine the jacobian of the mapping $z\to z^{*}$ or $j_{*}(z)$. We have
$$
\frac{\partial z^{*}_{i}}{\partial z_{j}}=-\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{i}\partial z_{j}}\log Q(z)
$$
so that
$$
j_{*}(z)=\left|-\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{i} \ \partial z_{j}}\log Q(z)\right|.
$$

If, as before, $dy$ denotes the euclidean volume element, we have, for the invariant volume element in $Y$,
$$
(Q(y^{*}))^{-N/q}dy^{*}=(Q(y))^{-N/q}dy
$$
or using \eqref{art13-eq3.4'},
$$
dy^{*}=(Q(y))^{-2N/q}dy.
$$
Since the symmetry $y\to y^{*}$ preserves orientation or not according as $N$ is even or odd, we get
\begin{align*}
&\left|\frac{\partial y_{i}^{*}}{\partial y_{j}}\right|=(-1)^{N}(Q(y))^{-2N/q},\\
\text{or}\quad & \left|\frac{\partial^{2}\log Q(y)}{\partial y_{i} \ \partial y_{j}}\right|=(-1)^{N}(Q(y))^{-2N/q}.
\end{align*}
It\pageoriginale is therefore obvious that
$$
j_{*}(z)=\left|-\dfrac{\partial^{2}\log Q(z)}{\partial z_{i} \ \partial z_{j}}\right|=(Q(z))^{-2N/q}.
$$
Combining this with \eqref{art13-eq3.11}, we get that \eqref{art13-eq3.8} holds also for $gz=z^{*}$; thus \eqref{art13-eq3.8} holds for all $g$ in $G$.

It is however clear that \eqref{art13-eq3.8}, which is really an algebraic identity, holds in a much larger group than $G$. Let us define $\widetilde{G}_{Y}$ as the group of complex matrices whose entries satisfy the algebraic relations which define $G_{Y}$ and consider the group $\widetilde{G}$ generated by translations $z\to z+a$ where $a$ may now be a complex vector, $z\to Az$ for $A$ in $\widetilde{G}_{Y}$ and $z\to z^{*}$. {\em Clearly} \eqref{art13-eq3.8} {\em as an algebraic identity holds for any transformation $g$ in $G$.}

The transformations of $\widetilde{G}$ do not, in general, map the positive half-space onto itself. $\widetilde{G}$ is actually large enough to map the positive half-space back into a bounded symmetric domain-in most cases, the original one (this being, for instance, true for the first three types listed at the end of \S\ref{art13-sec2}) --- or one may have to add a final unitary transformation which does not lie in $K_{0}$ (this being the case for type IV where the transformation $z_{1}\to z_{1}$, $z_{j}\to iz_{j}$ for $1<j\leq n$ would be needed at the end; for type IV, the positivity domain can be defined as $y_{1}>0$, $y^{2}_{1}-y^{2}_{2}-\cdots-y^{2}_{n}>0$ and we have $Q(y)=\frac{1}{2}(y^{2}_{1}-y^{2}_{2}-\cdots-y^{2}_{n})$; so the last transformation is needed to transform $z^{2}_{1}-z^{2}_{2}-\cdots-z^{2}_{n}$ into $z'z=z^{2}_{1}+\cdots+z^{2}_{n}$). At any rate, we get, in each case, the form of the differential operator and its transformation formula for the original bounded domain.

In the case of type I with $m=n$, we get, writing $\left|\dfrac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right|$ for $\left|\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z_{ij}}\right|$, that {\em if}
$$
gZ=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}
$$
{\em where $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are complex $(n,n)$ matrices such that $\left|\begin{smallmatrix} A & B\\ C & D\end{smallmatrix}\right|=1$, then}
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial gZ}\right|^{r}=|CZ+D|^{r+n}\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right|^{r}|CZ+D|^{r-n}.\label{art13-eq3.12}
\end{equation}

In\pageoriginale the case of type II, for $Z=Z^{(2n,2n)}$ and $Z'=-Z$, {\em let $g$ be the transformation}
$$
gZ=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}
$$
{\em where $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are $(2n,2n)$ complex matrices with the property that for $M=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} A & B\\ C & D\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $J=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} O & E\\ E & O\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, we have}
$$
M'JM=J
$$
and $|M|=1$. {\em Then writing $P_{f}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right)$ for $P_{f}\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z_{ij}}\right)$ where $P_{f}$ is the Pfaffian, we have}
\begin{equation}
\left(P_{f}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial gZ}\right)\right)^{r}=|CZ+D|^{(r+2n-1)/2}\left(P_{f}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right)\right)^{r}|CZ+D|^{(r-2n+1)/2}.\label{art13-eq3.13}
\end{equation}

{\em For type III, if we define}
$$
\left|\dfrac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right|=\left|\frac{1+\delta_{ij}}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{ij}}\right|
$$
{\em where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker symbol ($1$ on the main diagonal, $0$ off it) and $gZ=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}$ where, for $M=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} A & B\\ C & D\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $I=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & -E\\ E & 0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, we have $M'IM=I$ and $|M|=1$, then again}
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial gZ}\right|^{r}=|CZ+D|^{r+(n+1)/2}\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial Z}\right|^{r}|CZ+D|^{r-(n+1)/2}.\label{art13-eq3.14}
\end{equation}

In the case of type IV, we will confine ourselves to stating the form for the original bounded domain without defining the more general group $\widetilde{G}$ or giving the explicit forms of $g$ or the jacobian $j_{g}(z)$.

{\em If we define $D_{z}=\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}\dfrac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{i}^{2}}$, then}
\begin{equation}
D^{r}_{gz}=(j_{g}(z))^{-(r/n+1/2)}D^{r}_{z}(j_{g}(z))^{-(r/n-1/2)}.\label{art13-eq3.15}
\end{equation}

For the type VI, we do not give explicit formulas.

Since these differential operators only contain differentiations with respect to $z$ and not $\overline{z}$, we see that if, for real $\alpha$, we put in a factor $(k(z,\overline{z}))^{-\alpha}$ on the left side and a factor $(k(z,\overline{z}))^{\alpha}$ on the right ($k$ being again the Bergmann kernel function), we again get an operator which satisfies \eqref{art13-eq1.4} but the two multipliers $\rho_{g}$ and $\sigma_{g}$ have each been multiplied by $(j_{g}(z))^{\alpha}$.

Besides\pageoriginale the operators $D$ so constructed, we may, of course, also consider their complex conjugates $\overline{D}$. These do not satisfy \eqref{art13-eq1.4}, since we required our multipliers to be analytic in $z$. We note that $\overline{D}$ would transform in the way
$$
\overline{D}_{gz}=\overline{(j_{g}(z))}^{-\alpha}\overline{D}_{z}\overline{(j_{g}(z))}^{\beta},
$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depend on $D$. If we now define
$$
\widetilde{D}_{z}=(k(z,\overline{z}))^{-\alpha}\overline{D}_{z}(k(z,\overline{z}))^{\beta},
$$
we see that
$$
\widetilde{D}_{gz}=(j_{g}(z))^{\alpha}\widetilde{D}_{z}(j_{g}(z))^{-\beta}
$$
and so this operator has the required behaviour. Here, since the differentiations in $\widetilde{D}_{z}$ are with respect to $\overline{z}$ and not $z$, we can clearly replace the pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ by any other pair of real numbers $(\alpha',\beta')$ as long as
$$
\alpha'-\beta'=\alpha-\beta.
$$

It can be shown that all differential operators which satisfy \eqref{art13-eq1.4} can be obtained by combining the operators $D$ or $\widetilde{D}$ with suitable invariant differential operators of the kind mentioned under $(a)$ at the beginning of \S\ref{art13-sec2}.

\section{}\label{art13-sec4}
To find the general form of integral operators that transform in the required way, we may again look at the representation of the domain $B$ as a positive half-space where the analytic mappings $gz$ are real, which is to say : $g\overline{z}=\overline{gz}$. We have, of course, also that $j_{g}(\overline{z})=\overline{j_{g}(z)}$.

Considering the Bergmann kernel function of this half-space, we get thus
\begin{align*}
k(gz,g\overline{\zeta}) &= k(gz,\overline{g\zeta})\\
&= (j_{g}(z)\overline{j_{g}(\zeta)})^{-1}k(z,\overline{\zeta})\\
&= (j_{g}(z)j_{g}(\overline{\zeta}))^{-1}k(z,\overline{\zeta}).
\end{align*}
If we now write $\zeta$ instead of $\overline{\zeta}$, this becomes
$$
k(gz,g\zeta)=(j_{g}(z)j_{g}(\zeta))^{-1}k(z,\overline{\zeta}).
$$

From this, we see that if we put
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
h_{a,b}(z,\zeta)=\dfrac{(k(z,\overline{\zeta}))^{(a+b)/2}(k(z,\zeta))^{(a-b)/2}}{(k(\zeta,\overline{\zeta}))^{(a+b)/2}},\label{art13-eq4.1}
\end{equation}
where\pageoriginale $b>a$ and $b-a$ is such that $(k(z,\zeta))^{(a-b)/2}$ is single-valued for $z$ and $\zeta$ in the positive half-space\footnote[12]{This is true if $b-a$ is an integral multiple of $\frac{a}{N}$, since it is not hard to show that apart from a constant factor $k(z,\zeta)$ is equal to $(Q(\frac{z-\zeta}{2i}))^{-2N/q}$.}, then \eqref{art13-eq4.1} transforms in the way given by \eqref{art13-eq2.3}, with $\rho_{g}(z)=(j_{g}(z))^{-a}$, $\sigma_{g}(\zeta)=(j_{g}(\zeta))^{-b}$.

If $b<a$, we write
\begin{equation*}
h_{a,b}(z,\zeta)=\frac{k^{a}(z,\overline{z})}{k^{b}(\zeta,\overline{z})}\overline{h_{b,a}(\zeta,z)}.\tag{4.1$'$}\label{art13-eq4.1'}
\end{equation*}
The most general form of a kernel which transforms in the way given by \eqref{art13-eq2.3} is of the form
\begin{equation}
h(z,\zeta)=x(z,\zeta)h_{a,b}(z,\zeta)\label{art13-eq4.2}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is an invariant of the point pair $z$ and $\zeta$ while $h_{a,b}(z,\zeta)$ is given by \eqref{art13-eq4.1} or \eqref{art13-eq4.1'} according to the sign of $b-a$.

For the bounded domains, the form of the kernels is more complicated than for the positive half-spaces.

\section{}\label{art13-sec5}
For the reducible bounded symmetric domains, these same questions can be answered by using our results for the irreducible factors.

It is possible to generalize the problem we considered and ask similar questions for, say, bilinear operators operating on two functions are more generally, $q$-linear operators acting on $q$ functions; for instance, to be able to produce from two automorphic forms a new one which depends linearly on these two, but whose multiplier is not the product of the multipliers of these two forms. Again, one would begin by looking at the stability group of the point $O$ in $B$. Thus, for instance, it is easy to show that such bilinear operators exist for type I of $Z^{(m,n)}=Z^{(2n,n)}$, whereas for $Z^{(n,1)}$ there are no such $q$-linear operators for $q<n$.\footnote[13]{More generally, for $m\geq n$, such $q$-linear operators exist iff $q\geq m/n$.} Whether such multi-linear operators are of much interest is doubtful.

I originally determined the explicit transformation formulas for the differential operators considered in \S\ref{art13-sec3}, in the year 1960. My first aim was to construct operators that effected the shift in automorphy factors in the same way as the operators $y^{\alpha}\dfrac{d^{k}}{dz^{k}}y^{-\alpha}$ and $y^{k+1}\dfrac{d^{k}}{d\overline{z}^{k}}y^{k-1}$ do in the case of the upper half-plane.

Later, I used them to effect analytic continuation of Dirichlet series associated\pageoriginale with the Fourier expansions of modular forms in positive half-spaces where the Fourier expansion contains singular terms, and also to get the analytic continuation for the Dirichlet series associated with two such modular forms in the case when singular terms are present.

I lectured off and on, on these matters, the first time in Hamburg in the summer of 1961, later at various conferences, at Copenhagen (1964), Jyv\"askyl\"a (1970), Bar Ilan (1981) and other places abroad.

In the sixties, some of the applications were privately communicated to Hans Maass, Howard Resnikoff and Audrey Terras, all of whom (with my permission) utilised some of this material in their publications.
